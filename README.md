# AIRA (AI Routing Assistant)

In many companies, employees often need help from different departments, but they don't always know who to contact. For example, issues might relate to IT, HR, or Facilities, and it can be confusing to figure out the right point of contact.
 
AIRA (AI Routing Assistant) solves this problem. Employees can submit a message (a "ticket") through a website, and an AI agent reads the message, identifies the correct department using classification methods, and forwards the ticket accordingly. Department staff can then view and manage tickets through a dashboard.
 
Itâ€™s like having a smart assistant that always knows who can solve your problem.
